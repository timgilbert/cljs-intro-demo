cljs-intro-demo
===============

This is a small demo project intended to be used in a [little intro to clojure talk](https://github.com/timgilbert/cljs-intro-slides) I'm doing.

Get it compiling via `lein cljsbuild auto` in this directory.

It's just javascript.  To serve the files, it's easiest just to run
`serve` in the `www` directory.
